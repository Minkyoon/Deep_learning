There are several possible ways to estimate θ from the observed frequencies. For example, if we equate θ 2 with 187/1029, we obtain .4263 as an estimate of θ. Intuitively,
however, it seems that this procedure ignores some of the information in the other
cells. If we let X1, X2, and X3 denote the counts in the three cells and let n = 1029,
the log likelihood of θ is (you should check this):
